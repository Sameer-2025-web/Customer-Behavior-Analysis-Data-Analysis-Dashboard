## Project Overview
In this project, I worked with a real-world dataset and followed a structured data analytics process.  
I used SQL for data querying and transformation, Python for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Power BI to build an interactive dashboard for visualization and storytelling.

This project showcases my practical skills in data analysis and business intelligence.
